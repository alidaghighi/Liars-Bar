# Game Process of Liar's Deck:
1. At the beginning of each round, the system designates the "liar's card" type for this round (e.g., "Ace" or  "King").
2. Players take turns playing cards, 1-3 cards each time. For example, throw out 2 cards means the player claims to have played 2 "Aces".
3. The next player can choose to:
    - Believe the previous player's statement and play their own cards
    - Challenge the previous player's play (Call Liar!), indicating "I don't believe you just played 2 'Aces'". Then the system reveals the pile to verify.
        - If the previous player didn't play 2 cards (e.g., 0 "Aces"), the challenge is successful, and the previous player undergoes a death roulette judgment;
        - If the previous player indeed played 2 "Aces" (including Jokers), the challenge fails, and the challenging player undergoes a death roulette judgment;Gun
4. Death roulette judgment means firing the gun at oneself. If it's an empty chamber, the game proceeds to the next round; if successful, the player is eliminated, and the game continues to the next round
5. The game continues until only one player remains, who becomes the winner.Liars Deck Winner
